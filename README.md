## Work Experience

With a strong background in finance, I have gained valuable experience working in finance departments, where I developed a deep understanding of financial processes and performance measurement. My work involved creating and managing key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics to evaluate operational efficiency and drive strategic decision-making. Additionally, I have a proven ability to analyze large datasets, particularly for audit processes, ensuring data accuracy and compliance. This experience has honed my skills in data analysis, reporting, and identifying trends that are critical to optimizing financial operations.

## Projects

### [Video games sales analys (1980 - 2017)](https://github.com/Samuelpz1/Portfolio_DA/tree/main/Video%20Games%20Sales)

In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of video game sales from 1980 to 2017, exploring trends across various dimensions such as continent, gender, console, and year. The dataset allowed me to visualize global sales patterns and how they vary across different regions. Additionally, I examined demographic factors like gender preferences and how different consoles performed over time. This project highlights my ability to analyze large datasets, create meaningful visualizations, and provide insights into the gaming industryâ€™s evolution across continents and demographics.

### [Global Infant Mortality Analysis](https://github.com/Samuelpz1/Portfolio_DA/tree/main/Infant%20Mortality)

This project focuses on analyzing global infant mortality rates and related health indicators. This page provides a comprehensive view of global indicators such as life expectancy by continent and country, as well as the average rates of infant mortality and life expectancy. It also includes a map visualizing the impact of infant mortality across continents.

The second page delves deeper into country-specific data, showing how infant mortality rates affect different populations. A detailed map on this page highlights the impact by country, offering insights into regional disparities. This project demonstrates my ability to work with demographic data, create interactive visualizations, and present multi-layered insights.

This project showcases my ability of analysing and presenting large datasets by organizing and presenting global and country-level data on infant mortality and life expectancy, I was able to highlight significant regional differences and trends. The use of interactive visualizations, including maps, allowed me to effectively communicate the impact of these metrics.
